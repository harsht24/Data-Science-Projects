  1. BHP - Banglore House Price Prediction is end to end web application which can predict the house price in Bangalore City, India from given parameters such as-
    
     * Location in the city
     * BHK
     * Total Sqft of house
     * No. of Bathrooms
  2. Street view house numbers
     * Built a GAN using convolutional layers to generate new, realistic-looking images of house numbers.
     * Dataset : [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
     * Paper : [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
