  1. <a href='https://github.com/harsht24/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/BHP'>BHP - Banglore House Price Prediction </a> is end to end web application which can predict the house price in Bangalore City, India from given parameters such as-
    
     * Location in the city
     * BHK
     * Total Sqft of house
     * No. of Bathrooms
     
  2. <a href='https://github.com/harsht24/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/street_view_house_numbers-master'>Street view house numbers</a>
     * Built a GAN using convolutional layers to generate new, realistic-looking images of house numbers.
     * Dataset : [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
     * Paper : [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
   
  3. <a href = 'https://github.com/harsht24/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/sentiment_analysis_web_app-master'> Sentiment Analysis Web application</a>
     * Built an RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint.
     * Deployed on <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/'>AWS SageMaker</a>
   
  4. <a href='https://github.com/harsht24/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/iris-dataset-master'>Iris Flower Classification</a>
     * Built an end to end web application which classifies IRIS Flowers based on 4 classes.
     * 4 classes are-
        * sepal_length: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
        * sepal_width: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
        * petal_length: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
        * petal_width: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.
        * class: Iris Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, used as the target.
